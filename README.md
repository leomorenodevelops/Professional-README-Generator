# Professional-README-Generator

## Description
This project allowed me to use javascript with node.js to create a README.md file for user repository. A node.js application using the inquirer package will prompt the user for their input using the command line to generate the README.md file. During this project I learned how to use HTML markdown using Javascript and about node.js and using npm to install packages and using those packages for user input and using that input to generate a README file.

## Installation
1. Write/review Javascript.
2. npm init
3. npm install inquirer
4. Preview and test README Generator.
5. Push code to repo stored in GitHub.
